Principles of Low-Level Programming, which I took in the second semester included, among other things, the development of 5 projects.
My projects are stored in folders hw01-hw05, where you can find the full assignment. 
A short summary of the assignment is also here:


hamming
Your task will be to write a program that can encode and decode a stream of bytes from
standard input. The result of the encoding or decoding will be written to the standard output. +
Our modified version of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code[Hamming code] will be used for encoding,
whose algorithm is described in the next two sections.


poker
Your task will be to write a program that will communicate with the user
via the command line. Of course, your program will need to be able to
to compare card combinations with each other.

At the heart of the problem will be an algorithm for deciding which of two players
wins, knowing both players' cards and all five cards on the table.

container-explorer
In this homework problem, you will search containers. Fortunately, not their contents, 
but their location on the map. As part of your job at the city's technical services. 
you'll drive a garbage truck and load the contents of various containers. 
However, as a good computer scientist, you want to optimize your work as much as possible. 
On the city's website, you have found files with various information 
of all the existing containers. Now you just need to process the files, 
list them nicely, filter out only the ones you want, and implement the find 
the shortest path between them. So let's do it.

Settle up
Create a program that reads 3 input files - a list of people, a currency converter
and a list of past transactions. The output of the program will then be a record of who has
send how much money to whom to settle the debt. The application must be able to
work with multiple currencies, however, the debt will only be settled in the base currency.

dt
Your task will be to write a program that calculates the cumulative size of all items in the filesystem subtree specified by the path on the command line and 
print the current state of that subtree.
